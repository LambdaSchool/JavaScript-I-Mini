# JavaScript I Mini

### Topics
  * git
  * GitHub
  * Node

In this mini lab you will get your environment configured and practice the basics of `git`.

### Instructions

* Install `git` : https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Install `node` : https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* Fork this repo.
* Clone the fork you made onto your local machine. `git clone <fork_url>`
* Add a file to the repo called `script.js` that contains a single line of code: `console.log('hello world!');`
* Add your changes: `git add --all`
* Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
* Push your changes to your fork: `git push origin master`
* Submit a pull request back to the repo that you forked from (this repo).

* The short hand for every step from adding changes rolled into one, is: `git commit -am "<message>" && git push`
